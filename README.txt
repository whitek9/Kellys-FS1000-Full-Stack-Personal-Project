Hi Tarun & Mauro! Thanks for teaching us this course :)

I've learned a lot so far and have integrated some of my 
learnings with some pieces that my classmates have exposed 
me to (like flex!) which has been fun, doing lots of 
experimenting.

For JS validation, the function I've created only validates 
for empty fields (and only if it's the selected preferred
method of communication), however doesn't check for formatting.

I was looking into it and there's something called Regular
Expressions which I'm not familiar with, but I think would
help. I'm going to keep looking into them and have added it
to my personal backlog for the next phase of improvements.

You'll also notice some comments where I kept some ideas for
future features within my homepage, but those are stretch goals.

Otherwise, looking forward to your feedback!
